# n8n-nodes-elasticsearch-vector

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use Elasticsearch in your n8n workflows.

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of handling structured and unstructured data. This node leverages Elasticsearch's `semantic_text` feature for semantic search and hybrid queries.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

### Index Management
- Create an index with `semantic_text` mappings.
- Delete an index.

### Document Management
- Create a document with `semantic_text` fields.
- Get a document by ID.
- Delete a document by ID.

### Search
- Perform semantic searches using `semantic_text` fields.
- Execute custom searches using user-defined query templates.

## Credentials

To use this node, you need to authenticate with an Elasticsearch instance. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have an Elasticsearch instance running (version 8.9 or higher).
2. Obtain the necessary credentials (e.g., API Key, username, and password).
3. Configure the credentials in n8n by selecting "Elasticsearch API" in the node's credentials section.

## Compatibility

- Minimum n8n version: 0.200.0
- Tested with Elasticsearch version 8.9 and above.

## Usage

### Example: Hybrid Search Query

This node allows you to perform hybrid searches combining semantic and lexical queries. For example:

```json
{
  "retriever": {
    "rrf": {
      "retrievers": [
        {
          "standard": {
            "query": {
              "semantic": {
                "field": "respuesta_semantic",
                "query": "{query}"
              }
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "standard": {
            "query": {
              "match": {
                "respuesta": {
                  "query": "{query}"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `{query}` with your search term.
